I'm a graduate from the United Kingdom with an interest in programming and computer science theory. I do some programming for fun as a hobby; you can see some of my public projects [on my Github](https://github.com/tom-galvin). This Jekyll theme, Pixyll, was made by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) ([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)). The site itself is hosted on GitHub Pages.
