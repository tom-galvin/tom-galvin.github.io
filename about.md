I'm a student from the United Kingdom with an interest in programming and computer science theory. I do some programming for fun as a hobby; you can see some of my public projects on GitHub, where [I can be found here](https://github.com/Quackmatic). I also moderate the [/r/DailyProgrammer](http://reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer) subreddit, where we post challenges for you to solve to practice your programming.

This Jekyll theme, Pixyll, was made by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) ([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)). The site itself is hosted on GitHub Pages, meaning I don't have to pay for hosting - hooray.

## errata

I've made a habit of talking about things before I fully understand them. This means I might use incorrect terminology or write something that doesn't make complete sense. If anything on this blog is factually incorrect, please don't hesitate to [contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) so I can fix it.
