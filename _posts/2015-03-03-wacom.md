summary: A bash script to make Wacom tablets work properly with multiple screen setups.

I have a [Wacom Bamboo](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wacom-MTE-450-K2-DE-Bamboo-K-DE/dp/B000QUQDXM) graphics tablet that I use fairly infrequently. Today, however, I wanted to use it for a small demonstration. The problem was that the official support for Linux is considerably lacking. The tablet *does* work with the X.org Wacom driver (`xf86-input-wacom` in pacman), but it doesn't play well with multiple screens.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="A diagram showing the mapping of the graphics tablet surface to both screens at once." src="{{ site.base_url }}/images/wacom/1.png" /><br/>
  <span class="post-meta small">I have two displays side-by-side, but the tablet's surface maps to the entire X display - meaning that the square-ish region on the device maps to a long rectangular region on the screen.</span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="A demonstration of the bad aspect ratio resulting from this." src="{{ site.base_url }}/images/wacom/2.png" /><br/>
  <span class="post-meta small">This kills the aspect ratio.</span>
</div>

Luckily, a tool exists, named `xsetwacom`, to configure the device to your own display. For example, this following command maps the device to a single region:

{% highlight bash %}
xsetwacom --set "Wacom Bamboo stylus" MapToOutput "1920x1080+1920+120"
{% endhighlight %}

This, however, leads to another problem - what if the screen and the device surface don't have the same aspect ratio, either? The command above is a direct corner-to-corner mapping.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="A diagram showing the mapping of the graphics tablet surface to a single screen, with the wrong aspect ratio." src="{{ site.base_url }}/images/wacom/3.png" /><br/>
  <span class="post-meta small">The mapping is now more accurate, but the aspect ratio is still incorrect.</span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="A demonstration of the aspect ratio resulting from this correction; it's better than before, but still off." src="{{ site.base_url }}/images/wacom/4.png" /><br/>
  <span class="post-meta small">This means that drawn objects still look out of proportion.</span>
</div>

Luckily, someone has written [a bash script](https://bitbucket.org/denilsonsa/small_scripts/src/3380435f92646190f860b87f566a39d0e215034c/xsetwacom_my_preferences.sh?at=default) to fix this. It essentially letter-boxes the tablet surface to match the aspect ratio of the display you choose. The script requires some manual set-up, however, which I wasn't fond of - if your tablet has multiple inputs, such as a separate stylus and eraser, you will have to edit and set-up the script twice to configure both.

I decided to exercise my non-existent bash skills to fix this. I've fixed the script to work with non-VGA outputs, and also make it take the device as an argument. The new script is [available on Gist](https://gist.github.com/Quackmatic/6c19fe907945d735c045). To work with it, just run `mapwacom --help`. This will list the available options, including ones to print the names of all available screens and Wacom devices. <s>Unfortunately I'm too lazy to add valid error handling, so you'd better enter the screen and device names perfectly, or the script fails catastrophically.</s> (I've since re-written the script almost from scratch to support better interaction.)

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="A diagram showing the mapping from graphics tablet surface to one screen, with the correct aspect ratio." src="{{ site.base_url }}/images/wacom/5.png" /><br/>
  <span class="post-meta small">It's now possible to accurately use the graphics tablet without warping!</span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="A demonstration of the correct aspect ratio resulting from this correction. The demonstration is the text &quot;Hello world!&quot; in my hand-writing.." src="{{ site.base_url }}/images/wacom/6.png" /><br/>
  <span class="post-meta small">This is the resulting output, done with GIMP.</span>
</div>

Feel free to use the script. It might be useful to put it into your `.xinitrc`, so it runs whenever X does. You might need to re-run the script if you re-connect the graphics tablet, but this shouldn't be too much of an issue.
