The [first post]({% post_url 2014-11-01-mandelbrot %}) I put up on this website went up 10 years ago this weekend. A whole lot has changed since then, and this website hasn't received much TLC in that timeâ€”the SSL certificate was fully broken for a while and I didn't even notice. I've decided to do it a bit of justice, in case I still get any page views coming through from the [8.3 filename article]({% post_url 2015-06-09-filenames %}) which made it to the front page of Hackernews a while ago. Not that I would know, because I also lost access to the original Google Analytics account I used.

This site is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) running on GitHub pages. For the last 10 years or so, I've been using [John Otander's pixyll theme](https://github.com/johno/pixyll). It has done a good job but I've spent this weekend putting together a new look from scratch. It's pretty basic but I don't want anything too fancy for this now. It looks nice and is responsive on mobile.

The design is mostly held together with an incredibly nice font called [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/). It's mainly a monospace terminal font, which itself is nice, but it also has a proportional spaced variant too. Definitely worth checking out.
