summary: I've finally built myself a new computer, after several years of umming and ahhing.

Since 2008 I've been using the same pre-built Packard Bell box for essentially everything. It's a Core 2 Quad box and it's held up quite well - the processor didn't seem sluggish even though it's significantly out of date by now. However, the GeForce 9500 GT graphics card was already sub-par when I got it, and was practically off the bottom end of every possible benchmark that exists, so if I wanted to upgrade the graphics card, I may as well just start fresh. 

For about 2 or 3 years, I've been drawing up plans to finally build myself a new computer. Since I initially planned to do so, Sandy Bridge has came and gone, as has Ivy Bridge. So much so, in fact, that had I built a computer when I initially planned to do, it would've been quite dated now too. I'm off to University in September so this was my last chance to finally get round to doing so, so I bit the bullet and visited [r/BuildAPC](//reddit.com/r/buildapc) to see where to start - this would be the cause of the biggest issue I faced later on, but it got me going at least.

I initially settled on a GTX 960 and a Haswell Refresh Xeon processor. Both quite good hardware and would work well. I had initially planned to spend about £650 or thereabouts to make a computer that would last me about 2 or 3 years to be able to do some programming and medium gaming before things start getting slow. However I've been playing on Ultra Low settings in 720p for 5 years now and I wanted a change. I decided to up my budget to £750 and get a GTX 970.

I used a set of parts recommended by someone on IRC and, not wanting to be put of any further, purchased half the parts on that night. I went for a non-modular XFX 550 watt power supply, a MicroATX motherboard and a 1 TB hard drive. However, after ordering the processor, the shop I ordered from ([scan.co.uk](//scan.co.uk)) told me that processor wasn't in stock. I was a bit ticked off at this, as they didn't indicate this when I was purchasing it like essentially every other website in existence. I had three options - pay for a more expensive Xeon that was in stock, switch to a locked Core i5 processor with poorer performance, or go for the backup plan - the standard i5 4690K. I went for the latter and, as that shop had already caused me some issues, decided to buy it from [Aria](//aria.co.uk) instead.

The remainder of the parts arrived without issue. I went for a Fractal Design Core 1500 case. This was the part that caused me another issue; it was the first thing I ordered and it's a MicroATX case. It's a good sturdy case, if a little spartan, but getting a mATX case immediately constrained me in what I could physically fit inside the case. The equivalent Core 2500 case offers space for a full ATX motherboard, giving me more room for fitting gubbins in, but being limited to a MicroATX form factor, I would end up paying more for a motherboard which can physically fit less on. I had initially ordered the Gigabyte H81M-S2H motherboard, but after the palaver with the processor I needed to return it, or I wouldn't be able to overclock on the H81 chipset.

I got the equivalent Z97M-DS3H in the end, also from Gigabyte, but unfortunately only supporting one PCI-e slot, meaning SLI or Crossfire was out of the question. The PCI slots are also below the PCI-e slot, meaning that one of them is blocked by the graphics card, and the other would cause a PCI peripheral to be thoroughly cooked by the heat output from the GPU, which is a tad unfortunate, meaning I can't really use PCI wireless cards. The motherboard in all other respects is fine, featuring a good keyboard-and-mouse high resolution BIOS with more bells and whistles than you can shake a RAM stick at.

Of course, for overclocking, you'd set something on fire if you tried to use the stock Intel cooler. My only option was the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - anything bigger would not fit in my case (such as the current Noctua line-up) and anything smaller would lead to high temperatures. Luckily it sports a lot of cooling power, meaning I can achieve some decent overclocked frequencies.

Next, the graphics card arrived. I went with the Gigabyte edition of the GTX 970; they offer a G1 edition (with a backplate, fancy light, and supposedly higher overclocking capabilities). However the backplate would annoyingly mean I wouldn't be able to fit it on the motherboard due to the RAM socket being placed too far down the board. Therefore I went with the next model down, which is only a marginally worse overclocker - and about a pound lighter, due to the plastic shroud.

The case and SSD also arrived. I went with a Crucial BX100 solid-state drive with 250 GB of space, giving me more than enough room for the operating system, some crucial (har har) applications, and the games with the most loading screens. I got it quite cheap, too; £63 for a good performing drive. 3 years ago I would've paid about four times this amount for a similar SSD so in hindsight I'm glad I purchased this later on. The case itself finally arrived in a huge box. The air-flow is surprisingly good in the case after you remove one of the drive bays. It comes with two variable-speed fans with a surprisingly large amount of room for more, or even a 240mm water cooling radiator, which impressed me significantly - making my life easier, should I ever invest in a closed loop water cooler.

  <span class="post-meta small">The RAM is just some standard Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1600 sticks. 8 GB in total - I suspect I won't need more, but I have room to expand if need be. The heat-spreaders almost double the height of the RAM sticks, however, which isn't the friendliest of designs to people with small cases.</span>

Lastly I picked up the 1 TB hard drive as a cleaned salvage from Aria. I got it for £28 which was a steal - and I also took the 640 GB drive from my old computer which is still going strong, giving my more than enough hard drive space. Finally, the power supply arrived. I underestimated the sheer volume of wires, and cramming it all into the case in such a way to not make it look horrible was a challenge unto itself, but I managed it eventually.
