summary: How I migrated a VHD-based Windows 10 virtual machine to a physical partition.

My work requires me to use C# and ASP.NET MVC. This isn't a problem - I love C# and I think the ASP.NET MVC web framework is wonderful to work with. However, the .NET ecosystem, especially with regard to IDEs and MVC support, is lacking on every platform except Windows. Visual Studio is a very powerful and intuitive tool to work with, but the operating system limitation can be a bit of a pain sometimes.

I initially got around this by working from within a virtual machine. On my laptop, this worked quite well - it's certainly powerful enough to handle it, and it supports VT-x and VT-d so the processor doesn't run itself into overdrive (as well as supporting multi-core VMs which is super cool). However, it's not a great workflow to be constantly switching between Linux and Windows, especially on a single small display, and running a VM limits both your available RAM and your battery life.

However, I already had my workspace set up on Windows, within the virtual machine. I definitely didn't want to bother with re-installing everything again from scratch, and setting up licenses, and that mess. Hence, I thought... why not migrate my virtual machine to an actual physical partition? Surely it must be possible. I definitely couldn't imagine any *physical* limitation preventing me from doing so.

My laptop uses UEFI for booting, and so did the virtual machine I had set up. This process will likely be entirely different if you are not using UEFI and a GPT-based hard drive layout. This was quite a long process to do, and in hindsight, I saved absolutely no time whatsoever - however, it's quite a cool story to tell. Here are the steps I took to migrate my VHD-based Windows 10 virtual machine to a physical partition, and get it to boot.

To migrate your Windows installation to a physical partition, you need to make the partition first. This is easy enough to do; GParted offers a LiveCD (or LiveUSB) based distribution designed specifically for messing around with your partition table, and it's available [here](http://gparted.org/livecd.php). Put that onto a spare CD or a memory stick, boot into it (how you manage this depends on your own system) and fire up GParted.

Windows uses NTFS as its file system, so you're going to want to re-arrange your current partitions and make space for a Windows based partition. You're going to want a partition no less than 25 or 30 GB in size; I'm currently running my Windows installation in 42 GB of space with Visual Studio and other goodies installed, with about 15 GB to spare - and you really don't to have any less empty space lest you run into swapping or SSD performance issues.

GParted supports creation of NTFS partitions directly so I won't provide a step-by-step description of how to do this. However, while I'm at this point, I will mention that Windows, if installed the standard way, will create not one but up to four partitions on your disk. These are:

* **The EFI system partition**. If you're using a UEFI-based system you will already have this - it stores your bootloader, your Linux image, boot configuration files amongst other things. It's just a FAT32 partition that your motherboard firmware will initially boot into, and if you are dual-booting, will probably contain more than one bootloader. This is the only time you'll likely ever see Linux-related and Windows-related executables on the same partition co-existing; I have both `systemd-boot` and the Windows Boot Manager installed in my ESP.
* A *Microsoft Reserved* partition. I have no idea what this is or will be used for, and I think that Microsoft doesn't either. This doesn't seem to be used at all, and my laptop is running Windows fine without one.
